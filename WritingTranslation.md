# Howto write a translation file (Deprecated) #

cd into "your ntorrent dir"/language and copy English.lang to "Yourlanguage".lang. Open the file in your favourite text editor and edit the text on the right side of the equality ( = ) symbol.

When done run the java tool "native2ascii yourlanguagefile.lang yourlanguagefile.lang" which converts unsupported characters to escaped unicode characters.

Then contact me if you wish to make your translation public.
