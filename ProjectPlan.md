# Project plan #

  1. 100% support for all functionality in rTorrent
  1. Implement user settings functionality
  1. a new slim and fast "nTorrent protocol" to give richer functionality to the end user whilst still having flexibility.
  1. Implement a more advanced add torrent functionality, which files to download, what label to set the torrent to, priorities etc etc.
  1. Enable file- transfer/deletion/execution from nTorrent with ssh, local and the new nTorrent protocol.
  1. Implement download manager.
  1. A greater level of module based application structure, giving easy flexibility in what the end user want out of the program, what features to be included/excluded.
  1. it's a secret, but the keyword is, JavaFX :)
**and more.....**

More to come..
